<p>Deadmau5 is a Canadian electronic DJ/dance artist and record producer. Blessed with excellent skills in electronics, he displays a variety of styles in his works, and uses different forms of electronic music. He has worked with several famous DJs and producers on a number of releases. Nominated for the Grammy Awards six times, deadmau5 is well known for his trademark helmet and popular live shows. In the initial years of his career, he had created the buzz for his brand of electronic music on the indie dance site ‘Beatport’, and his works were included in compilation albums and DJ playlists. He then created ‘deadmau5.com’ and started uploading songs to SectionZ from 2002. This dance-music superstar describes himself as being very unsocial with a “huge anxiety disorder”, and is the happiest when left all alone. Best known for the dance music hits ‘Ghosts 'n' Stuff,’ ‘I Remember,’ and ‘Strobe’, he has tried his hand at everything in the electronic spectrum. He has been often described by the media as an incredibly humble and loyal individual, who just wants to do his best for his fans.
